# competitiveCommunicators
Building upon the framework of 'dynamic communicators' to reveal the effects of competition of relaying nodes in message exchanges in a network over time.

# Implements the 'dynamic communicability' measure of:

# Here we test to see if the influence of nodes over times, if evolving can alter the communicability as accumulated broadcast power.
